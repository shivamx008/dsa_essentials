    // Now we will talk about multi dimensional arrays.
    // they can be 2d, 3d and n-d , n-dimensional arrays are used in machine learning and deep learning
    // for real life use cases, 1d is used to store eg student roll and marks
    // 2d in the same scenario could be used by a class teacher to store roll on y axis and different sub marks on x axis
    // SO the ith row will represent the marks of i roll student

    //So where can we see use of 3d matrixes, 
    // colored Images have to represented by 3d matrixes because , they have a cmponent of r g b. height and breadth is the size of the image and each cell has a depth of 3 cell to accomodate r val b val g val.

    //4-d data could be dimension of time , like frames of a video.
